# SpotiHelper
SpotiHelper is a simple application made in C# that uses non-intrusive methods* to fetch the currently playing Spotify song.
The main feature of this application is being able to save the currently playing Spotify song to a txt-file, making it extremely useful for streamers wanting to show the currently playing song.

*non-intrusive methods:
The application reads the title of the Spotify application that displays the currently playing song.
It uses PInvokes to achieve this.
